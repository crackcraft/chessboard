chessboard
==========

Joomla plug-in for integration of chessboard.js into article text.
Inspired by EmbedChessboard.

To use, you have to insert in the article:

  [chessboard {attributes}]
    {configuration}
  [/chessboard]

Where

    {attributes} are any allowed html attributes of DIV element (except ID)
      http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp
      
    {configuration} is a valid configuration of chessboard.js instance
      http://chessboardjs.com/docs
      
Example

  [chessboard class="myboard" style="width: 300px" ]
    position: "r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R",
    orientation: "black",
    showNotation: false
  [/chessboard]

Default set of attributes and configuration can be set in plug-in's configuration.
The sets are merged with parameters, defined in article (and overridden in case of collision) 
NB! All html tags are stripped out from the parameters defined in article.
